# Detection-of-Alive-Human-Body-in-Warfields
The wireless communication technology is rapidly spreading to new areas such as data  acquisition, building control, monitoring system and many more. This technology is also  used in military area. Most of the military organization takes the help of robot for solving  many risky jobs that cannot be done by the soldiers. These system uses a specific set of  sensors and wireless components. During military, the human will suffer a lot. Many lose  their life because of not begin treated in time. A timely rescue can only save the people  who are buried and wounded.  In such situations, rescue system must take fast decisions under pressure and try to  get victims to safe location at their own risk.Detection by rescue workers becomes time  consuming and due to the vast area that gets affected it becomes more difficult. In the  field of Military defence, soldiers need a high security and backup force for his afterward  attack and at the same time security office need a live data for the soldier who is in field  for attack and his alive detection for the backup force attack. These microcontroller based circuit is used for rescuing alive human robot may  identify live human being under debris in Military and save the most valuable human life. . We have created a basic prototype of the functioning using Pulse sensor which detects  the Pulse rate and senses whether a person is alive or not in a war field.
